Assignment 3:

Please code the solution for CLRS problem 15-6 "planning a company party", which I am reproducing below for your convenience, with very minor modifications. 

Professor Stewart is consulting for the president of a corporation that is planning a company party. The company has a hierarchical structure; that is, the supervisor relation forms a tree rooted at the president. The personnel office has ranked each employee with a conviviality rating, which is a real number. In order to make the party fun for all attendees, the president does not want both an employee and his or her immediate supervisor to attend.

Professor Stewart is given the tree that describes the structure of the corporation, using the left-child, right-sibling representation (each node x has attributes x.parent, x.leftchild, and x.rightsibling). Each node of the tree holds, in addition to the pointers, the name of an employee and that employeeâ€™s conviviality ranking. Write C code to make up a guest list that maximizes the sum of the conviviality ratings of the guests.
